1. We are being asked to implement a chat client and server service. Up to 255
users can be affiliated with the server at any one time. To make things easier,
there will be a separate observer and participant client. The purpose of the
participant is to prompt a user for messages. The purpose of the observer is
to display the various messages that users are sending. Messages can be
broadcast to everyone in the group, or they can be sent to a single participant.

2. I anticipate using select and/or poll correctly will be the most
challenging aspect of the assignment, because we have never used these system
calls before. It may also be tedious to do all the string processing that will
be necessary if we want to correctly determine which observer to send a
personalized message to. Setting up the server and client looks similar to what
we did in the first two projects. We also dealt with having multiple
participants in the game.

3. I will utilize the man pages on select and poll, Brian's wisdom, and the
textbook.
